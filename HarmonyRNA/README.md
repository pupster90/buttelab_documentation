# HarmonyRNA Documentation

This is an overview of the harmonyRNA project. This documentation is for reserchers who intend to develop the project further. HarmonyRNA is a web tool for harmonizing RNA-Seq data in TPM and Counts format. The documentation provides and introductory explanation about the project and then gives advice on how to go about coding up changes to it. Below is a list all available resources related to HarmonyRNA

**List of 10k Immunomes Resources**
* [Website](https://10kimmunomes.ucsf.edu/): This is the 10k Immunomes website. The purpose of all this documentation is to allow you to understand how this website is built so that you can begin building you own version.
* [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/pwBs4J4xDOw): This video tutorial is a beginners overview of what the 10k Immunoems project is about. Watching the video is the best way to starting learning about 10k Immunomes.
* [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16xouMFAHRIXzRuIgKzalHpPLNAwJRUgS/view?usp=sharing): This is a published describing 10k Immunomes. Rading the paper is a good way to learn more about the purpose of 10k Immunomes.
* [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pupster90/10kimmunomes/tags): This docker image is by far the easiest way to start working on this project. It contains a detailed step by step tutorial on how to get website up and running, how to edit code, and how to publish final results to the server.
* [Github](https://github.com/pupster90/10k_Immunomes): This github repo contains all of the source code. It's useful for scanning through the files. However, I HIGHLY reccomend using the dockerhub image when working on code.
* [10k Immunomes Documentation](https://github.com/pupster90/buttelab_documentation/tree/master/10kImmunomes): HarmonyRNA was used to harmonize data from the 10k Immuomes project. This is also the example dataset that's up on the websited and that was used in the tutorial video. To learn more about 10k Immuomes, you should read it's documentation.
